# Phase AJ Governance Lock: UI Governance & Read-Only Product Surfaces

## 1. Status and Scope
- Classification: DESIGN-ONLY
- Execution Status: EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED
- Governance Level: Product Governance Lock

## 2. Purpose of This Lock
Phase AJ MUST be frozen to establish a definitive baseline for UI governance and read-only product surfaces. This lock ensures that the design intent is preserved as an immutable reference point, explicitly preventing UI-to-execution drift by decoupling visual specifications from operational capabilities.

## 3. Locked Phase AJ Artifacts
The following artifacts are hereby frozen:
- Phase AJ-01 UI Governance and Interaction Rules
- Phase AJ-02 Read-Only UI Scaffolding
- Phase AJ-03 Read-Only Navigation and Surface Shells
- Phase AJ-04 Read-Only Proposal Visualization and Comparison
- Phase AJ-05 Read-Only Proposal Traceability and Rationale

## 4. Binding Authorities
This lock is bound by and must be interpreted in accordance with:
- architecture-baseline-declaration.md
- phase-w-execution-design-lock.md
- phase-x-execution-planning-lock.md
- phase-y-execution-skeleton-lock.md
- phase-z-execution-governance-lock.md
- phase-ai-governance-lock.md
- phase-ag-governance-lock.md
- phase-ah-governance-lock.md
- platform-status.md

## 5. Execution Status Declaration
Execution is explicitly BLOCKED. No UI artifact defined within Phase AJ confers or implies authority for runtime execution, state mutation, or operational deployment.

## 6. Prohibited Interpretations
- No UI readiness inference: Visual definitions MUST NOT be interpreted as readiness for implementation or execution.
- No “harmless UI” reinterpretation: Non-operational UI shells MUST NOT be deployed under the guise of being "harmless" or "read-only" in a runtime environment.
- No internal-only operational use: Artifacts MUST NOT be used for internal operational activities.
- No future execution justification: The existence of these design artifacts MUST NOT be used as a justification for bypassing future execution governance.

## 7. Permitted Activities After This Lock
- Documentation review ONLY
- Planning for future phases ONLY
- No runtime activity MAY occur

## 8. Explicitly Blocked Activities
- Any execution MUST NOT occur.
- Any persistence of state MUST NOT occur.
- Any submission, confirmation, or state mutation MUST NOT occur.
- Any backend wiring MUST NOT occur.
- Any analytics or telemetry MUST NOT occur.

## 9. Change Control Rules
Phase AJ artifacts are immutable. Any modification to the scope or content of Phase AJ requires a new governance phase and a subsequent governance lock.

## 10. Relationship to Future Phases
Phase AK and beyond MAY proceed without modifying Phase AJ artifacts. Phase AJ remains binding unless explicitly superseded by a future governance lock.

## 11. Closing Governance Statement
This document authorizes NOTHING. EXECUTION REMAINS BLOCKED.
