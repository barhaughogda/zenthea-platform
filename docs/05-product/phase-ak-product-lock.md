# Phase AK Product Governance Lock

## 1. Status and Scope
- **Classification:** DESIGN-ONLY
- **Execution Status:** EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED
- **Governance Level:** Product Governance Lock

## 2. Purpose of This Lock
This lock freezes Phase AK as the authoritative correction of product intent following Phase AJ exploration. It establishes the design baseline for product surface realignment.

## 3. Locked Phase AK Artifacts
The following artifacts are locked under this governance:
- `phase-ak-01-product-surface-realignment-brief.md`

## 4. Binding Authorities and Dependencies
This lock is bound by and must maintain alignment with all applicable architecture, execution, governance, and product locks established up through Phase AJ.

## 5. Execution Status Declaration
Phase AK does not enable, prepare, imply, or justify execution. Execution remains blocked and is not authorized by this lock.

## 6. Canonical Product Intent Declaration
- Booking and scheduling MUST be treated as the current canonical vertical.
- Patient-first and provider-patient-list-first principles MUST be treated as binding for all subsequent design activities.

## 7. Supersession of Exploratory UI Assumptions
Phase AK MUST supersede any conflicting assumptions, patterns, or requirements derived from Phase AJ UI exploratory artifacts.

## 8. Explicitly Blocked Interpretations
- Phase AJ UI MUST NOT be interpreted as final UX.
- Phase AK MUST NOT be used to justify assistant behavior, execution readiness, or workflow automation.

## 9. Permitted Activities After This Lock
- Design planning activities aligned with this lock MAY proceed.
- Further design-only refinement and clarification aligned with Phase AK intent MAY proceed.

## 10. Explicitly Blocked Activities
- Any runtime execution MUST NOT be initiated.
- Any persistence activation MUST NOT occur.
- Any assistant autonomy MUST NOT be implemented.
- Any UX finalization beyond booking-centric clarification MUST NOT be pursued.

## 11. Change Control Rules
- Phase AK artifacts are immutable under this lock.
- Any changes to the intent or scope defined herein MUST require a new explicit governance phase and a subsequent lock.

## 12. Relationship to Future Phases
Phase AK-02 and subsequent design phases MAY proceed only if they remain strictly aligned with the mandates of this lock.

## 13. Audit and Review Expectations
This lock MUST be treated as a binding reference during all future governance, architecture, and product reviews.

## 14. Closing Governance Statement
- This document authorizes NOTHING operational.
- EXECUTION REMAINS BLOCKED.
