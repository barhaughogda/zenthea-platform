# Phase AM-01: Booking Execution Readiness Decomposition

## 1. Status and Scope
- This document MUST be classified as DESIGN-ONLY.
- EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED.
- The scope MUST be strictly limited to the conceptual decomposition of booking execution readiness boundaries.
- All definitions and decompositions herein MUST be interpreted as theoretical governance structures.

## 2. Purpose of This Document
- This document MUST define the requirements for theoretical execution readiness within the booking domain.
- It MUST NOT be used to justify, initiate, or sustain any operational execution.
- It MUST serve as a governance boundary between product intent and potential future execution frameworks.

## 3. Binding Authorities and Dependencies
- This document MUST be subordinate to all existing platform governance and product-lock artifacts.
- It MUST NOT override any established safety or security protocols.
- All future execution-related artifacts MUST reference this document but MAY NOT claim authorization from it.

## 4. Definition of “Execution Readiness” in Booking Context
- Execution Readiness MUST be defined as the state where a booking unit has satisfied all theoretical governance and risk criteria.
- Readiness MUST NOT imply permission to execute.
- Readiness MUST be evaluated independently for each decomposed unit.

## 5. What Execution Readiness IS NOT
- Execution Readiness MUST NOT be interpreted as implementation progress.
- It MUST NOT represent a timeline or a roadmap.
- It MUST NOT imply the existence of functional code, APIs, or infrastructure.

## 6. Decomposition of Booking Into Potentially Executable Units
- Booking MUST be decomposed into discrete, non-overlapping theoretical units for governance analysis.
- Each unit MUST be evaluated for its specific risk profile and governance requirements.
- These units MUST remain abstract and MUST NOT be mapped to specific software components or services.

## 7. Human Cognitive vs System-Executable Boundaries
- A clear boundary MUST be maintained between human cognitive intent and potential system-executable instructions.
- Human intent MUST always remain the primary authority.
- System-executable boundaries MUST be defined to prevent unauthorized autonomous action.

## 8. Preconditions Required for Any Booking Execution Unit
- Every theoretical execution unit MUST satisfy a set of mandatory safety and governance preconditions.
- These preconditions MUST include, but are NOT limited to, absolute traceability and human-in-the-loop requirements.
- Satisfaction of preconditions MUST NOT result in automatic execution authorization.

## 9. Explicit Non-Executable Units (Never Allowed)
- Certain booking units MUST be classified as PERMANENTLY NON-EXECUTABLE.
- Units involving irreducible ethical judgment or non-traceable human values MUST NOT be automated or executed.
- Any attempt to define execution for these units MUST be blocked.

## 10. Assistant Participation Constraints
- AI assistants MUST NOT initiate, approve, or verify the execution of any booking unit.
- Assistant participation MUST be limited to the generation of governance-compliant design artifacts.
- Assistants MUST NOT have access to execution triggers or operational keys.

## 11. Risk Concentration and Failure Containment Principles
- Decomposition MUST ensure that risk is not concentrated within a single theoretical unit.
- Failure containment boundaries MUST be defined for every potentially executable unit.
- Systemic risk MUST be mitigated through strict isolation of governance domains.

## 12. Explicitly Blocked Interpretations
- Interpretation of this document as a "go-ahead" for development MUST be blocked.
- Any inference of operational readiness from these theoretical decompositions MUST be rejected.
- This document MUST NOT be cited as a source of permission for any API or UI implementation.

## 13. Relationship to Future Execution Phases
- Future execution phases MAY use these decompositions as a governance baseline.
- No future phase MAY claim that this document provides the necessary authorization for deployment.
- The transition from theoretical decomposition to operational implementation MUST require separate, explicit authorization.

## 14. Closing Governance Statement
- EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED.
- This document authorizes NOTHING operational.
- All governance boundaries defined herein MUST be maintained until explicitly superseded by a subsequent authorized governance artifact.
