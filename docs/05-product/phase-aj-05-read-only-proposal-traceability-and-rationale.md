# Phase AJ-05: Read-Only Proposal Traceability and Rationale Surfaces

**Classification:** DESIGN-ONLY / READ-ONLY PRODUCT  
**Phase:** AJ-05  
**Document Type:** Governance Policy  
**Effective Date:** 2026-01-15  
**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## 1. Status and Scope

This document is classified as **DESIGN-ONLY / READ-ONLY PRODUCT**.

**EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED.**

This document governs the visualization of proposal traceability and rationale within the Zenthea platform. All surfaces described herein are strictly read-only and non-operational. No provision of this document enables execution, evaluation, decision-making, persistence, or any operational activity.

All UI work governed by this document MUST remain in read-only, visualization-only form.

---

## 2. Purpose of This Phase

Phase AJ-05 introduces the capability to visualize proposal traceability and rationale without enabling any evaluative or operational action.

Traceability and rationale matter prior to any decision or execution because:

- Users MUST be able to understand where proposals originated
- Users MUST be able to inspect the assumptions underlying proposals
- Users MUST be able to view the constraints that shaped proposals
- Transparency of provenance supports informed human consideration
- Understanding context does NOT constitute evaluation or endorsement

This phase does NOT:

- Enable evaluation of proposals
- Enable scoring, ranking, or recommendation of proposals
- Enable selection, confirmation, or execution of any proposal
- Enable persistence of traceability or rationale data
- Authorize any form of decision-making or operational activity

## 4. Definition of "Proposal Traceability"

### 4.1 What Traceability IS

Proposal traceability in Phase AJ-05 MUST be understood as:

- The factual record of where a proposal originated
- The chain of sources, inputs, and constraints that informed proposal construction
- A descriptive provenance that explains the proposal's existence
- A neutral accounting of which systems, data sources, or processes contributed to the proposal
- Historical context presented without judgment

### 4.2 What Traceability IS NOT

Proposal traceability in Phase AJ-05 MUST NOT be:

- A validation of proposal correctness
- A measure of proposal quality or fitness
- Evidence of execution readiness
- Justification for selection or approval
- A basis for comparative ranking
- Authorization for any operational action

---

## 5. Definition of "Proposal Rationale"

### 5.1 What Rationale IS

Proposal rationale in Phase AJ-05 MUST be understood as:

- A factual explanation of why a proposal was constructed as it was
- A description of the assumptions that were applied
- An accounting of the constraints that were honored
- A neutral statement of the logic used in proposal formation
- Contextual information supporting human comprehension

### 5.2 What Rationale IS NOT

Proposal rationale in Phase AJ-05 MUST NOT be:

- An argument for why the proposal is correct
- A justification for selection or preference
- A defense of the proposal against alternatives
- Evidence that the proposal should be executed
- A persuasive case for adoption
- Authorization for any operational action

---

## 6. Permitted Traceability Surfaces

Traceability surfaces MAY include:

---

## 7. Prohibited Traceability Semantics

### 7.1 No Justification of Correctness

Traceability surfaces MUST NOT:

- Claim that a proposal is correct because of its provenance
- Imply that origin confers validity

- Present provenance as evidence of quality

### 7.2 No Validation Language

Traceability surfaces MUST NOT include:

- Terms such as "validated", "verified", "certified", or "approved"
- Language implying that traceability constitutes endorsement
- Statements suggesting that provenance equals correctness
- Assertions that origin guarantees fitness for purpose

### 7.3 No Readiness Inference

Traceability surfaces MUST NOT:

- Imply that a proposal is ready for execution
- Suggest that traceability indicates deployment eligibility
- Present provenance as a precondition for operational activity
- Link traceability to execution authorization

### 7.4 No Implied Approval

Traceability surfaces MUST NOT:

- Use language that implies the proposal has been approved
- Present provenance as a form of endorsement
- Suggest that traceability conveys authority to proceed
- Display indicators that could be mistaken for approval status

---

## 8. Rationale Neutrality Requirements

### 8.1 Factual, Descriptive Tone Only

All rationale content MUST:

- Use factual, descriptive language exclusively
- State what was done and why in neutral terms

### 8.2 No Persuasive Framing

Rationale content MUST NOT:

- Attempt to persuade users toward any conclusion

## 14. Closing Governance Statement

**EXECUTION REMAINS BLOCKED.**

All UI work produced under this specification is for visualization of traceability and rationale only. No provision of this document enables, permits, or authorizes:

- Evaluation or scoring of any proposal
- Selection, confirmation, or execution of any proposal
- Persistence of traceability or rationale data
- Transmission of provenance data to backends
- Decision-making based on displayed rationale
- Any operational activity whatsoever

**This document authorizes NOTHING.**

Traceability and rationale surfaces described herein are ephemeral, informational, and carry no execution authority. Browser refresh MUST completely erase all traceability and rationale state.

This document is audit-ready and regulator-safe. It contains no code, APIs, schemas, hooks, libraries, diagrams, examples, or pseudo-code.
