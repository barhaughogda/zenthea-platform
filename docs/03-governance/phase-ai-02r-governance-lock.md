# Phase AI-02R Governance Lock

## 1. Status and Scope
- **Classification**: DESIGN-ONLY
- **Execution Status**: EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED
- This document serves as a governance lock for Phase AI-02R (Red-Team Analysis of Execution Precondition Enforcement).

## 2. Purpose of This Lock
- This lock MUST freeze the adversarial findings documented in Phase AI-02R.
- This lock MUST prevent the reinterpretation, selective application, or dilution of identified risks.
- This lock MUST ensure that adversarial findings are maintained as binding constraints on all future design activities.

## 3. Locked Phase AI-02R Artifacts
- The following artifact is locked and MUST NOT be modified:
  - `phase-ai-02r-red-team-analysis-of-execution-precondition-enforcement.md`

## 4. Binding Authorities and Dependencies
- This lock is bound by and dependent upon the following authoritative documents:
  - `docs/01-architecture/architecture-baseline-declaration.md`
  - `docs/01-architecture/phase-w-execution-design-lock.md`
  - `docs/02-implementation-planning/phase-x-execution-planning-lock.md`
  - `docs/02-implementation-planning/phase-y-execution-skeleton-lock.md`
  - `docs/03-governance/phase-z-execution-governance-lock.md`
  - `docs/03-governance/phase-ag-governance-lock.md`
  - `docs/03-governance/phase-ah-governance-lock.md`
  - `docs/03-governance/phase-ai-01-minimal-executable-action-specification.md`
  - `docs/03-governance/phase-ai-02-execution-precondition-enforcement-model.md`
  - `docs/00-overview/platform-status.md`

## 5. Governance Effect of This Lock
- All Phase AI-02R red-team findings MUST be treated as binding constraints on future execution design.
- Identified red-team risks MUST be treated as unresolved until explicitly mitigated by subsequent governance phases.
- Any future proposal for execution enablement MUST demonstrate explicit mitigation of the risks identified in Phase AI-02R.

## 6. Execution Status Declaration
- **EXECUTION REMAINS BLOCKED**.
- This lock does NOT mitigate, resolve, or override any findings documented in Phase AI-02R.
- This lock does NOT authorize the transition to any operational or executable state.

## 7. Prohibited Interpretations
- Participants MUST NOT treat Phase AI-02R findings as advisory, optional, or informational.
- Participants MUST NOT proceed with execution enablement while Phase AI-02R findings remain unaddressed.
- Participants MUST NOT scope-limit, reframe, or downplay the risks identified in Phase AI-02R to bypass governance constraints.

## 8. Permitted Activities After This Lock
- Participants MAY engage in design discussions regarding the AI-02R findings.
- Participants MAY draft mitigation proposals to address the identified risks.
- These activities MUST NOT involve the creation of executable code or the activation of platform capabilities.

## 9. Explicitly Blocked Activities
- **Execution Enablement**: No activity MAY enable executable actions.
- **Partial Enforcement Rollout**: No partial enforcement of preconditions MAY occur.
- **Assistant-Mediated Validation**: No AI-assistant mediated validation of enforcement logic MAY be performed.
- **Human Override**: No human participant MAY override the constraints established by the red-team findings.

## 10. Change Control Rules
- The Phase AI-02R artifact is immutable while this lock is active.
- Any modification to Phase AI-02R findings or the status of this lock MUST require a new explicit governance phase and a corresponding lock.

## 11. Relationship to Future Phases
- Phase AI-03 or later phases MAY proceed ONLY to address and mitigate the findings identified in Phase AI-02R.
- This lock MUST remain binding unless explicitly superseded by a subsequent governance lock that addresses the locked risks.

## 12. Closing Governance Statement
- This document authorizes NOTHING operational.
- **EXECUTION REMAINS BLOCKED**.
