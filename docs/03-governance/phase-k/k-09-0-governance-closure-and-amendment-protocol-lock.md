# Phase K.9.0 — Governance Closure & Amendment Protocol Lock

## 1. Governance Framework Closure Declaration
The Zenthea Platform v1 Governance Framework is hereby declared **COMPLETE** and **CLOSED**. 

All governance artifacts spanning Phase J.x and Phase K.x, specifically including all locks through Phase K.8.5, are designated as **FINAL**, **IMMUTABLE**, and **AUTHORITATIVE**. These documents constitute the definitive regulatory and operational boundary for the Zenthea Platform.

## 2. Default Governance State: READ-ONLY
By default, the Zenthea Governance Framework is **READ-ONLY**. 

The framework serves as the permanent record of authorized system behavior, risk controls, and compliance mandates. It is not subject to interpretation, clarification, or modification through practice, culture, or tooling.

## 3. Amendment Protocol
The Zenthea Governance Amendment Protocol is the **SINGLE** and **ONLY** permitted mechanism for modifying the governance framework. 

### 3.1 Authorized Causes for Amendment
Amendments are strictly restricted to the following conditions:
1. **Regulatory or Legal Requirement Changes**: Mandated changes by governing bodies or legal jurisdictions.
2. **Material Change in System Risk Profile**: Identification of new, significant risks that require governance-level mitigation.
3. **Expansion into New Regulated Domains**: Entry into markets or clinical domains not covered by the v1 framework.

### 3.2 Amendment Requirements
All authorized amendments MUST adhere to the following standards:
- **Additive or Versioned**: Amendments must be explicitly added as new phases or versioned updates to existing locks.
- **No Retroactive Weakening**: Amendments shall never retroactively weaken or reinterpret existing governance locks.
- **Explicit Modification**: Governance shall never be modified silently or implicitly. All changes must be documented within this protocol's structure.

## 4. Prohibited Actions
The following actions are strictly **FORBIDDEN**:
- **Clarifications and Reinterpretations**: "Clarifying" existing locks to bypass controls.
- **Shadow Governance**: Maintaining unofficial or parallel governance procedures.
- **Convenience-Driven Changes**: Modifying governance to accommodate operational speed or developer convenience.
- **Temporary/Emergency Modifications**: Suspending governance for "emergency" situations without a formal, audited exception path defined in K.8.4.
- **Governance Drift**: Allowing system behavior to diverge from governance through gradual shifts in practice.

## 5. Separation of Concerns
- **Governance Amendments**: Rare, heavyweight, high-integrity operations requiring full architectural and compliance review.
- **Product Execution**: Continuous, high-velocity evolution occurring strictly *within* the boundaries defined by the governance framework.

## 6. Compliance Enforcement
Any unauthorized modification to the governance framework, or any system behavior that deviates from these locks without an authorized amendment, constitutes **NON-COMPLIANT SYSTEM BEHAVIOR**. Such incidents must be treated as critical security and compliance breaches.

## 7. Terminal Phase Declaration
Phase K.9.0 is the **TERMINAL** governance phase for the Zenthea Platform v1 Framework. No further phases are authorized under the v1 designation.

## 8. Lock Statement
- **Phase K.9.0 is DESIGN-ONLY.**
- **Phase K.9.0 is FINAL and IMMUTABLE once committed.**
- **Any deviation from this protocol requires a formal governance amendment as defined herein.**
