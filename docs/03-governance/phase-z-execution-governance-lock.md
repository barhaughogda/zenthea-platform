# Phase Z Execution Governance Lock

## 1. Status and Scope
- **Classification:** DESIGN-ONLY
- **Status:** EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED
- **Governance Level:** This document constitutes a formal governance lock.

## 2. Purpose of This Lock
This lock is established to formally freeze Phase Z (Z-01 through Z-05) as the canonical and binding execution-enablement governance baseline for the Zenthea platform. The lock prevents any reinterpretation, modification, or expansion of the Phase Z artifacts without an explicit, new governance phase. Freezing these artifacts ensures a stable and immutable foundation for all subsequent governance and planning activities.

## 3. Locked Phase Z Artifacts
The following artifacts are hereby enumerated and locked under this governance declaration:
- Phase Z-01 Execution Enablement Authority Model
- Phase Z-02 Execution Readiness Evaluation Framework
- Phase Z-03 Execution Enablement Act Specification
- Phase Z-04 Execution Scope Declaration Framework
- Phase Z-05 Execution Oversight and Drift Detection Framework

## 4. Binding Authorities
The following documents are recognized as binding authorities in relation to this lock:
- architecture-baseline-declaration.md
- phase-w-execution-design-lock.md
- phase-x-execution-planning-lock.md
- phase-y-execution-skeleton-lock.md
- execution-architecture-plan.md
- integration-slice-01.md
- integration-slice-02.md
- integration-slice-03.md
- integration-slice-04.md
- integration-slice-05.md
- platform-status.md

## 5. Execution Status Declaration
Platform execution remains explicitly **BLOCKED**. No document or framework within Phase Z (Z-01 through Z-05) provides authorization for, or enablement of, any runtime execution.

## 6. Prohibited Interpretations
Interpretations of Phase Z artifacts that suggest any form of execution enablement are strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to:
- No implicit enablement through inference or structural readiness.
- No partial enablement of specific components or services.
- No internal-only or developer-mode enablement.
- No "safe mode" or "read-only" runtime execution.
- No shadow, background, or passive execution paths.

## 7. Permitted Activities After This Lock
The following activities are permitted following the establishment of this lock:
- Technical and governance documentation review.
- Legal and regulatory compliance assessment.
- Board of Directors and executive leadership review.
- Planning for future governance phases.
- No runtime activity is authorized.

## 8. Explicitly Blocked Activities
The following activities MUST NOT be performed and remain strictly blocked:
- Any form of runtime execution or process activation.
- Any configuration changes intended to enable or bypass execution blocks.
- Any operational use of defined execution paths.
- Any activation of persistence layers tied to operational execution.

## 9. Change Control Rules
- All Phase Z artifacts (Z-01 through Z-05) are immutable.
- Any modification to the Phase Z baseline MUST be initiated through a new, explicit governance phase and corresponding lock.
- No amendments to Phase Z may be made by inference, interpretation, or secondary documentation.

## 10. Relationship to Future Phases
Governance phases designated as Phase AA or later MAY build upon the foundations established in Phase Z. However, this Phase Z lock remains binding and in full effect unless explicitly superseded by a subsequent, higher-level governance lock.

## 11. Closing Governance Statement
This document authorizes NOTHING in terms of operational execution. It is a governance lock for design and framework purposes only.
The Zenthea platform reaffirms: **EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED**.
