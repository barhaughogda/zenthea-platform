# Phase AH Governance Lock

## 1. Status and Scope
**Classification:** DESIGN-ONLY  
**Execution Status:** EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED  
**Governance Phase:** Phase AH (Governance Evolution Baseline)  

This document MUST apply to the entirety of the Zenthea Platform governance framework as established in Phase AH. Its scope MUST be limited to the design of governance evolution and conflict resolution models.

## 2. Purpose of This Lock
The purpose of this lock MUST be to freeze the design of the Phase AH governance evolution baseline. This lock MUST prevent any recursive, implicit, or unauthorized mutation of governance behaviors. It MUST ensure that the evolution of governance itself MUST be governed by the rules established herein.

## 3. Locked Phase AH Artifacts
The following artifacts MUST be considered frozen and immutable under this lock:

### Phase AH-01 Governance Evolution and Lock Revision Model
- This model MUST define how governance locks MAY be revised in future phases.
- It MUST explicitly state that no governance lock MAY be modified without a new named governance phase.

### Phase AH-02 Governance Conflict and Precedence Model
- This model MUST define the hierarchy and precedence of governance documents.
- It MUST ensure that conflict resolution MUST follow the established binding authorities.

## 4. Binding Authorities
This lock MUST be subordinate to and MUST maintain consistency with the following documents:
- `architecture-baseline-declaration.md`
- `phase-w-execution-design-lock.md`
- `phase-x-execution-planning-lock.md`
- `phase-y-execution-skeleton-lock.md`
- `phase-z-execution-governance-lock.md`
- `phase-ag-governance-lock.md`
- `platform-status.md`

## 5. Execution Status Declaration
**EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED.** This document MUST NOT be interpreted as authorizing any operational activity, implementation, or deployment. All governance behaviors defined in Phase AH MUST remain in a DESIGN-ONLY state.

## 6. Prohibited Interpretations
- This lock MUST NOT be interpreted as authorizing any execution or operational inference.
- It MUST NOT be interpreted as permitting implicit changes to existing governance locks.
- No language in this document MAY be construed as a vendor, tooling, or timeline commitment.

## 7. Permitted Activities After This Lock
- Design-only review of Phase AH artifacts MAY occur.
- Planning for future governance phases MAY proceed, provided such planning MUST NOT modify Phase AH artifacts.
- Audit and regulatory review of this governance baseline MAY be performed.

## 8. Explicitly Blocked Activities
- **EXECUTION IS BLOCKED:** No implementation of Phase AH governance models MUST occur.
- **MUTATION IS BLOCKED:** No modification of Phase AH artifacts MUST occur without a new named governance phase.
- **OPERATIONAL INFERENCE IS BLOCKED:** No operational procedures MAY be derived from this design-only lock.

## 9. Change Control Rules
Any proposed change to the Phase AH governance baseline MUST require:
1. Initiation of a new, named governance phase.
2. Formal retirement or amendment of this lock via a successor governance document.
3. Explicit approval from the Governance Steward.

## 10. Relationship to Future Phases
Future phases MAY build upon this baseline, but MUST NOT retroactively alter Phase AH without following the Change Control Rules defined in Section 9. This lock MUST serve as the immutable foundation for all subsequent governance evolution.

## 11. Closing Governance Statement
The Phase AH governance evolution baseline is hereby locked. This baseline MUST ensure that the platform's governance remains stable, predictable, and audit-ready. EXECUTION REMAINS EXPLICITLY BLOCKED.
