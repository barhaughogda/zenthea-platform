# Phase AG-01: Controlled Enablement Thought Experiment

## 1. Status and Scope
**Status:** DRAFT / CONCEPTUAL TEST
**Scope:** Governance Design Verification
**Execution Status:** EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED. This document authorizes NOTHING operational.

This document serves as a design-only governance artifact. It is a controlled thought experiment designed to test the integrity of the existing Zenthea governance stack. It MUST NOT be interpreted as a request for implementation, a roadmap, or an enablement of any system behavior.

## 2. Purpose of This Document
The purpose of this document is to perform an "execution enablement thought experiment" against the locked architecture and governance frameworks. It verifies that the current controls are sufficient to govern a hypothetical transition from "Locked" to "Enabled" for a single domain. 

EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED.

## 3. Binding Authorities and Locked Baselines
This thought experiment acknowledges the absolute authority of the following canonical locks and declarations:
- `docs/01-architecture/architecture-baseline-declaration.md`
- `docs/01-architecture/phase-w-execution-design-lock.md`
- `docs/02-implementation-planning/phase-x-execution-planning-lock.md`
- `docs/02-implementation-planning/phase-y-execution-skeleton-lock.md`
- `docs/03-governance/phase-z-execution-governance-lock.md`
- `docs/05-product/phase-ab-product-lock.md`
- `docs/05-product/phase-ac-product-lock.md`
- `docs/05-product/phase-ad-product-lock.md`
- `docs/05-product/phase-ae-product-lock.md`
- `docs/05-product/phase-af-product-lock.md`
- `docs/00-overview/platform-status.md`
- `docs/00-overview/phase-lock-index.md`

All hypothetical scenarios described herein MUST conform to these baselines.

## 4. Definition of “Thought Experiment” (IS / IS NOT)
**IS:**
- A conceptual verification of governance logic.
- A stress test of Z-series protocols.
- A static audit artifact.

**IS NOT:**
- A plan for execution.
- A proposal for code changes.
- A selection of vendors or tools.
- An enablement of any runtime environment.

EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED.

## 5. Assumed Starting State (Canonical)
The assumed starting state is the current "Locked" state of the Zenthea Platform, where all domains are strictly governed by the Phase Lock Index and no execution is authorized beyond the design-lock stage.

## 6. Hypothetical Enablement Candidate (Single Domain)
The single candidate domain selected for this thought experiment is: **Scheduling & Orders**.

This choice is purely for conceptual validation. This domain remains LOCKED in the canonical state.

## 7. Preconditions Checklist (Conceptual Only)
In a hypothetical enablement scenario, the following preconditions MUST be satisfied:
1. Complete alignment with `docs/01-architecture/architecture-baseline-declaration.md`.
2. Verified adherence to the design constraints in `docs/01-architecture/phase-w-execution-design-lock.md`.
3. Satisfaction of all readiness criteria defined in `docs/03-governance/phase-z-02-execution-readiness-evaluation-framework.md`.

## 8. Evidence Pack Required (Conceptual Only)
A hypothetical enablement candidate would require a comprehensive Evidence Pack, including:
- Proof of zero-deviation from the Design Lock.
- Comprehensive security and compliance audit reports.
- Signed attestation from Governance leads.

## 9. Human Review Sequence (Conceptual Only)
The conceptual review sequence for enablement MUST include:
1. Technical Oversight Board (TOB) review of the Evidence Pack.
2. Compliance and Risk review for regulatory alignment.
3. Final Executive authorization.

## 10. Enablement Act Cross-Check (Z-03)
According to `docs/03-governance/phase-z-03-execution-enablement-act-specification.md` (Z-03), an explicit "Enablement Act" is required to transition any domain to an active state. This thought experiment confirms that NO such act has been performed or is proposed here.

## 11. Scope Declaration Cross-Check (Z-04)
Per `docs/03-governance/phase-z-04-execution-scope-declaration-framework.md` (Z-04), any hypothetical enablement MUST be accompanied by an explicit Scope Declaration. This document confirms that NO scope for the "Scheduling & Orders" domain has been declared or authorized.

## 12. Oversight and Drift Cross-Check (Z-05)
Per `docs/03-governance/phase-z-05-execution-oversight-and-drift-detection-framework.md` (Z-05), active oversight and drift detection MUST be operational upon enablement. Since EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED, no such oversight mechanisms are currently active for the "Scheduling & Orders" domain.

## 13. Failure and Halt Cross-Check (S-03, X-05)
Any conceptual enablement MUST include fail-closed semantics and "kill-switch" protocols as referenced in S-03 and X-05 frameworks. These mechanisms ensure that any deviation from the governance baseline results in an immediate halt of operations.

## 14. Explicitly Blocked Interpretations
- This document MUST NOT be used as a basis for procurement.
- This document MUST NOT be used as a justification for starting code development in the "Scheduling & Orders" domain.
- This document MUST NOT be used to bypass any requirement in the Phase Z Governance Lock.

## 15. Closing Governance Statement
This thought experiment concludes that the current governance stack provides sufficient theoretical control to manage the enablement process, should such a process ever be authorized. However, at this time, ALL domains remain LOCKED. 

EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED.
