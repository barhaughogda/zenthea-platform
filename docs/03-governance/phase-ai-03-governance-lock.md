# Phase AI-03 Governance Lock: Execution Risk Mitigation Requirements

## 1. Status and Scope
- Classification: DESIGN-ONLY / GOVERNANCE LOCK
- Execution Status: EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED
- This document is a governance lock. It authorizes NOTHING.

## 2. Purpose of This Lock
- Freeze Phase AI-03 mitigation requirements as immutable governance obligations.
- Prevent reinterpretation or dilution of mitigation requirements.

## 3. Locked Artifact
- The following artifact MUST be considered locked and immutable:
  - docs/03-governance/phase-ai-03-execution-risk-mitigation-requirements.md

## 4. Binding Authorities and Dependencies
- List these as binding authorities (do not restate their contents):
  - docs/01-architecture/architecture-baseline-declaration.md
  - docs/01-architecture/phase-w-execution-design-lock.md
  - docs/02-implementation-planning/phase-x-execution-planning-lock.md
  - docs/02-implementation-planning/phase-y-execution-skeleton-lock.md
  - docs/03-governance/phase-z-execution-governance-lock.md
  - docs/03-governance/phase-ag-governance-lock.md
  - docs/03-governance/phase-ah-governance-lock.md
  - docs/03-governance/phase-ai-01-minimal-executable-action-specification.md
  - docs/03-governance/phase-ai-02-execution-precondition-enforcement-model.md
  - docs/03-governance/phase-ai-02r-red-team-analysis-of-execution-precondition-enforcement.md
  - docs/03-governance/phase-ai-02r-governance-lock.md
  - docs/00-overview/platform-status.md

## 5. Execution Status Declaration
- Reaffirm that execution remains BLOCKED / NOT ENABLED.
- State that this lock does not permit any runtime behavior.

## 6. Prohibited Interpretations
- AI-03 requirements MUST NOT be treated as optional guidance.
- Policy, training, or intent MUST NOT be substituted for mitigation properties.
- Partial, probabilistic, deferred, or advisory mitigations MUST NOT count as compliance.
- Proceeding to any execution authorization without satisfying AI-03 requirements MUST NOT occur.

## 7. Permitted Activities After This Lock
- Documentation review, design review, evidence modeling, and governance planning MAY proceed.
- Implementation and enablement MUST NOT proceed under this lock.

## 8. Explicitly Blocked Activities
- Any execution, persistence activation, background workers, schedulers, or runtime enablement MUST NOT occur.
- Any attempt to bypass or weaken mitigation requirements MUST NOT occur.

## 9. Change Control Rules
- AI-03 requirements are immutable.
- Any change MUST require a new governance phase and a new lock that explicitly supersedes this one.

## 10. Relationship to Future Phases
- A future phase (e.g., AI-04) MAY only demonstrate satisfaction of AI-03 requirements.
- No phase MAY treat AI-03 as satisfied without verifiable evidence and governance approval.

## 11. Closing Governance Statement
- This document authorizes NOTHING.
- EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED.
- The AI-03 mitigation requirements remain binding and locked.
