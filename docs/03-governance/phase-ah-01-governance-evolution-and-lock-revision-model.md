# Phase AH-01: Governance Evolution and Lock Revision Model

## 1. Status and Scope
This document is CLASSIFIED as **DESIGN-ONLY** and serves as a **GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK**. It defines the conceptual model for the evolution of governance within the Zenthea Platform. This document applies strictly to the governance of governance locks (Phases W through AG) and their potential revision, supersession, or retirement. **EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED** by this document.

## 2. Purpose of This Document
The purpose of this framework is to define the theoretical mechanisms by which the platform’s governance structures MAY be modified. It establishes the rules for how existing governance locks MAY be adjusted to reflect platform maturity while ensuring that no such adjustment inadvertently enables execution or erodes the integrity of established blocks.

## 3. Binding Authorities and Dependencies
All revisions to governance locks MUST be authorized by the designated Platform Governance Authority. This framework depends on the existence of Phases W through AG and MUST NOT be interpreted as overriding any specific block unless the formal revision process defined herein is successfully concluded in a future, execution-enabled phase.

## 4. Definition of “Governance Evolution”
“Governance Evolution” MUST be defined as the formal, controlled process of updating governance specifications to align with new architectural requirements, regulatory changes, or platform milestones. It represents a conceptual transition from one state of governance to another, maintaining a continuous audit trail of all changes.

## 5. What Governance Evolution IS NOT
Governance Evolution MUST NOT be used as a shortcut to bypass established execution blocks. It IS NOT a mechanism for operational implementation, it IS NOT an authorization for code deployment, and it IS NOT a waiver of security or compliance requirements. It remains strictly within the domain of governance design.

## 6. Authority to Initiate Governance Revision
The authority to initiate a conceptual revision of any governance lock MUST reside solely with the Platform Governance Board. No individual contributor, developer, or automated system MAY initiate a revision without explicit, recorded authorization from this Board.

## 7. Preconditions for Revising a Governance Lock (Conceptual)
A governance lock MAY only be considered for conceptual revision if the following preconditions are met:
- A formal requirement for revision is identified and documented.
- The impact of the revision on all dependent governance phases is analyzed.
- The revision MUST NOT reduce the overall security or compliance posture of the platform.
- **EXECUTION REMAINS BLOCKED** throughout the revision analysis.

## 8. Governance Revision Process (Conceptual, Non-Operational)
The conceptual process for revising a governance lock MUST include:
1. Formal Proposal: Identification of the lock and the proposed change.
2. Impact Assessment: Analysis of downstream effects on the governance framework.
3. Review: Evaluation by the Platform Governance Board.
4. Finalization: Updating the governance documentation to reflect the new state.
No part of this process MAY involve the execution of code or the modification of operational systems.

## 9. Supersession vs Amendment Rules
- **Supersession**: A governance lock MAY be superseded when a new document entirely replaces the previous lock. The old lock MUST be marked as RETIRED and the new lock MUST reference the superseded document.
- **Amendment**: A governance lock MAY be amended for minor clarifications or updates that do not change the fundamental intent of the lock. Amendments MUST be tracked via version control.

## 10. Prohibited Governance Actions
The following actions are STRICTLY PROHIBITED:
- Implicitly retiring a governance lock through non-reference.
- Modifying a governance lock to enable execution within a DESIGN-ONLY phase.
- Authorizing any operational activity through a governance revision.
- **EXECUTION MUST NOT BE ENABLED** through any governance evolution activity.

## 11. Preservation of Execution Blocking
The primary objective of this model is the preservation of execution blocking. Any evolution or revision of governance MUST explicitly state that **EXECUTION REMAINS BLOCKED**. The transition from a blocked state to an enabled state is outside the scope of this document and MUST be handled by a separate, execution-specific governance phase.

## 12. Relationship to Future Governance Phases
This Phase AH-01 framework provides the conceptual foundation for all subsequent governance evolution. Future phases (AI and beyond) MAY build upon these rules to implement operational changes, but only after the platform has transitioned out of the current restricted state.

## 13. Change Control Rules
All changes to this document or any document governed by this model MUST follow strict version control procedures. Each change MUST be accompanied by a clear rationale and MUST be reviewed and approved by the Platform Governance Board.

## 14. Closing Governance Statement
This document defines the model for governance evolution and lock revision. It authorizes no operational activity and enables no platform execution. **EXECUTION REMAINS BLOCKED** under all existing governance locks until such time as a formal, execution-enabled phase is authorized and implemented.
