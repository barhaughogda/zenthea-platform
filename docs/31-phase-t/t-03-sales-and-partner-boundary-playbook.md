# Phase T-03: Sales & Partner Boundary Playbook

## 1. Title and Status
- Phase: **T-03**
- Status: **Design-Only**
- Execution State: **BLOCKED**

## 2. Purpose
This document exists to protect governance integrity during sales and partner conversations. It is intended to prevent misrepresentation, scope creep, and informal attempts to bypass execution controls. It does not authorize execution, access expansion, or any operational change.

## 3. Relationship to Phase T
This artifact assumes Phase T prerequisites remain in force:
- Phase **T-01** remains a prerequisite.
- Phase **T-02** remains a prerequisite.

T-03 completes Phase T as the final boundary and communications artifact. Phase T is not considered complete unless T-01 and T-02 are satisfied and this playbook is used as the canonical sales/partner governance reference.

## 4. Sales Posture Principles
- **Conservative**: Statements do not exceed what is demonstrably true in the current, blocked execution state.
- **Non-promissory**: Commitments, timelines, and implied future capabilities are not provided.
- **No speculation**: “What could be built” or “what might be enabled” is not discussed as a sales deliverable.
- **No pilots**: Execution pilots, limited pilots, or trial execution are not offered or implied.
- **No “exceptions”**: Exceptions, carve-outs, and special access paths are not authorized.

## 5. Canonical Sales Questions and Approved Responses
The responses below are phrased to remain calm, governance-based, and demo-forward. They do not describe implementation steps, timelines, or enablement pathways.

### Q: “Can we try this with one clinic?”
- **Calm refusal**: “No. Execution is not authorized, even for a single clinic.”
- **Governance-based explanation**: “The system is governed to remain observational only; execution remains blocked and is not available for pilots or exceptions.”
- **Redirect to demo value**: “The observational demo remains the correct channel for showing value; it does not act on real systems and does not perform actions.”

### Q: “Can execution be enabled for a pilot?”
- **Calm refusal**: “No. Execution remains blocked and is not authorized for any pilot.”
- **Governance-based explanation**: “Governance requires that execution remains disabled; sales discussions do not change execution state and are not a channel for enablement decisions.”
- **Redirect to demo value**: “The demo remains limited to controlled, observational scenarios that do not perform actions.”

### Q: “What would it take to turn this on?”
- **Calm refusal**: “That question is not answered in sales conversations. Execution remains blocked.”
- **Governance-based explanation**: “Enablement pathways, requirements, or conditions are not provided externally. Governance prohibits describing steps that could be interpreted as an enablement plan.”
- **Redirect to demo value**: “The demo remains the appropriate reference point for observable behavior, auditability, and boundary enforcement, without discussing enablement.”

### Q: “Can this write to the EHR?”
- **Calm refusal**: “No. The demo does not write to EHRs, and execution remains blocked.”
- **Governance-based explanation**: “External system writes are not authorized in this mode. Sales is not authorized to represent write capability or ‘future write’ as available.”
- **Redirect to demo value**: “The demo remains limited to review and oversight in an observational workflow; it does not make changes to clinical systems.”

## 6. Explicitly Prohibited Sales Statements
Sales is not authorized to use statements that imply enablement, timelines, exceptions, or future capability. The phrases below are examples and are not exhaustive. Sales is not authorized to say:
- “We can enable later.”
- “This will be possible soon.”
- “Execution is coming.”
- “We can turn it on for a pilot.”
- “We can give you limited access.”
- “We can do a special exception for your org.”
- “We can integrate and write to your EHR in the next phase.”
- “We can flip a switch if you sign.”
- “We can run this in your environment as a trial.”

## 7. Pressure Escalation Handling
When pushed for exceptions, pilots, timelines, or enablement pathways:
- **What Sales does**: Sales pauses, re-states the boundary, and does not negotiate execution state.
- **Who Sales escalates to**: Sales escalates to the **Governance Owner** (or designated Governance Lead), and includes **Legal** and **Product Governance** as required.
- **Language to use while escalating**: “Execution remains blocked and I’m not authorized to discuss enablement conditions. I will route this request through formal governance review.”

## 8. Partner Conversation Rules
Partner conversations are framed as observational evaluation only. Partners are not treated as an alternate route to execution.

Partner conversations do not include:
- **No sandbox execution**: Sandbox execution remains blocked; “safe sandbox” framing is not authorized.
- **No shared credentials**: Shared credentials, shared keys, shared accounts, or “temporary access” is not authorized.
- **No “limited access”**: “Limited access,” “restricted mode,” or “special partner mode” is not authorized.

## 9. Demo Boundary Reinforcement
The demo is observational only:
- **No configuration**: Demo viewers do not change configuration.
- **No toggles**: No toggles, switches, or hidden controls are presented as available.
- **No hidden modes**: There is no “internal mode” or “partner mode” that changes execution state.

## 10. Internal Alignment Requirements
- **Sales**: Sales references this document as the canonical boundary for external conversations.
- **Legal**: External language that could be interpreted as a promise, commitment, or enablement pathway is not authorized without Legal alignment.
- **Product**: Capability claims are not authorized without Product alignment; claims remain bounded by “observational only” and “execution remains blocked.”

Deviations from this playbook are not authorized without formal governance review and written approval by the Governance Owner and Legal.

## 11. Explicit Prohibitions
- No pilots (not authorized).
- No exceptions (not authorized).
- No shadow execution (not authorized).
- No promises (not authorized).
- No timelines (not authorized).

## 12. Phase T Closure Statement
Phase T governance is considered complete only after this document is adopted as the boundary playbook, and the prerequisites in T-01 and T-02 remain satisfied.

## 13. Closing Governance Statement
Execution remains **BLOCKED**. This document authorizes understanding only and does not authorize access expansion, operational change, or any execution capability.
