# Phase T Governance Freeze Declaration

**Status:** GOVERNANCE FROZEN  
**Execution State:** BLOCKED

## 1. Purpose of Governance Freeze
Phase T represents the terminal governance boundary for the Zenthea Platform. This freeze is enacted to establish a deterministic state for all regulatory, auditor, and partner-facing documentation. By declaring a governance freeze, the platform ensures that its compliance posture remains stable and that further governance expansion is prohibited, providing a fixed baseline for regulatory review.

## 2. Scope of Freeze
The governance freeze encompasses all artifacts and definitions within the following phases:
- **Phase R (Demo):** All canonical scenarios and demo behaviors are locked.
- **Phase S (Execution Governance):** All protocols for execution unblocking and emergency halts are locked.
- **Phase T (Regulator and Auditor Posture):** All walkthrough packs, inspection playbooks, and partner boundaries are locked.

## 3. What This Freeze Means
Governance documentation is now authoritative and final. From this point forward, all governance artifacts are classified as **READ-ONLY** reference materials. No new governance phases or expansions of the existing framework will be initiated, except in response to a documented security incident or a direct regulatory mandate.

## 4. Explicitly Prohibited Activities
The following activities are strictly prohibited under the Phase T Governance Freeze:
- **Governance Revisions:** No modifications to existing governance documentation or policy.
- **Demo Behavior Alterations:** No changes to the canonical behavior of demo artifacts.
- **Execution Enablement:** No activities that move the platform from a BLOCKED execution state to an ACTIVE execution state.
- **External Reinterpretation:** No reinterpretation of these governance standards by sales teams, partners, or third-party stakeholders.

## 5. Allowed Work After Freeze
Work may continue only within the following strictly defined parameters:
- **Internal Experimentation:** Private, internal execution experimentation may proceed, provided it remains entirely separate from the frozen demo track and is not referenced in governance artifacts.
- **Sales Enablement:** Sales and partner engagement must use only the existing, frozen Phase T artifacts.
- **Track Isolation:** Strict isolation must be maintained between the frozen demo track and any private execution experimentation.

## 6. Track Transition Declaration
The Governance Track of the Zenthea Platform is hereby declared **CLOSED**. The execution experimentation track may proceed privately. The Demo track remains the frozen and canonical representation of the platform's governed intent.

## 7. Relationship to ROADMAP.md
In accordance with `ROADMAP.md`, Phase T is marked as the **GOVERNANCE TERMINAL POINT**. Any future phases related to execution, scaling, or production deployment are explicitly outside the scope of this governance envelope and this declaration.

## 8. Closing Governance Statement
This declaration authorizes the transition of the governance framework to a frozen state. It does **NOT** authorize the execution, implementation, or production deployment of the platform. Execution remains **BLOCKED** by default.
