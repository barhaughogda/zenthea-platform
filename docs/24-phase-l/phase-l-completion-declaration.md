# Phase L Completion Declaration

## 1. Status Summary
- **Phase**: L
- **Status**: Design Complete
- **Execution**: BLOCKED

## 2. Scope Covered
- **L-01**: Non-Executing Assistant UI Implementation Plan
- **L-02**: Demo Interaction Flows
- **L-03**: Demo Assembly and Readiness Definition
- **L-04**: Demo Environment Configuration

## 3. What Phase L Achieves
- **Demo readiness**: Establishes the framework for a controlled, design-only demonstration environment.
- **Non-executing assistant UX**: Defines the visual and navigational components of the assistant interface without underlying logic.
- **Governed interaction flows**: Maps specific user paths through the demonstration interface.
- **Safe, showable product surface**: Provides a visual representation of the product for stakeholder review that cannot perform actions.

## 4. What Phase L Does NOT Authorize
- **No implementation**: This declaration does not permit the writing of application code.
- **No execution**: No logic or processing capabilities are authorized.
- **No automation**: Automated workflows and background processes remain prohibited.
- **No backend services**: Integration with or development of backend systems is not permitted.
- **No voice capture systems**: Audio recording and processing capabilities are strictly unauthorized.

## 5. Demo Readiness Statement
This declaration clarifies that Phase L authorizes **demonstration only**. The purpose is to provide a visual walkthrough of the platform's intended user experience within a static, non-functional environment for the purpose of design validation and stakeholder alignment.

## 6. Execution Block Statement
It is explicitly restated that all execution remains **blocked**. No active code or functional services are permitted to operate under this declaration.

## 7. Forward Path
- **Phase M: Controlled Pilot Enablement (design-only)**: The next phase will focus on the design of controlled pilot environments, maintaining a strict non-executing posture.

## 8. Closing Governance Statement
This document serves as a record of design alignment only. It does not constitute authorization for development, deployment, or operation of the Zenthea platform. Execution capabilities remain strictly prohibited until further governance review and explicit authorization.
