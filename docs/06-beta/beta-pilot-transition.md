# Beta Pilot Transition: From Mock to Constrained Pilot

## 1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the operational transition from Zenthea Beta v1 (Mock Consultation Loop) to a constrained, production-grade pilot. It establishes the conditions, constraints, and human responsibilities required to move from simulation-only environments to limited interactions involving real clinicians and real data (PHI).

## 2. Current State: Beta v1 (Mock Consultation)
Zenthea Beta v1 operates strictly within a "Mock" environment:
- **Data Type**: 100% synthetic or de-identified mock data. No PHI is permitted.
- **Scope**: Narrow "Mock Consultation Loop" simulation.
- **Users**: internal testing team and designated "mock" clinicians.
- **Behavior**: Simulated clinical outputs with no impact on real patients.

## 3. Target State: Constrained Pilot Usage
The Pilot Phase moves the Mock Consultation Loop into a controlled clinical setting:
- **Data Type**: Real Patient Health Information (PHI) within a HIPAA-compliant environment.
- **Scope**: Limited real-world patient-clinician interactions utilizing the Zenthea assist interface.
- **Users**: Pre-vetted pilot clinicians only.
- **Outcome**: Real-time clinical documentation assistance and decision support for authorized human review.

## 4. Preconditions for Pilot Readiness
Before transitioning to the Constrained Pilot, the following must be verified:
1. **Technical Stability**: Completion of the Mock Consultation Loop beta with zero critical bugs.
2. **HIPAA Compliance**: Verification of data encryption at rest and in transit.
3. **Legal/Ethical Framework**: Finalized Patient Consent forms and Clinician Terms of Use.
4. **Human Review Protocol**: Signed agreement from pilot clinicians to review and approve all Zenthea outputs.

## 5. What Changes from Mock to Pilot
| Feature | Mock Beta v1 | Constrained Pilot |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Source** | Synthetic / Static | Real Patient Intake / PHI |
| **User Interaction** | Internal Simulation | Authorized Clinician Use |
| **Environment** | Sandbox | Production-Grade (Secure) |
| **Liability** | None (Non-Clinical) | Human-in-the-Loop Clinical Review |

## 6. What Remains Explicitly Forbidden During Pilot
- **Autonomous Behavior**: Zenthea must not send any communication or finalize any record without explicit human "Click-to-Approve."
- **General Availability**: No self-service signup; all users must be manually onboarded.
- **Autonomous Diagnosis**: Zenthea does not "diagnose"; it suggests content for human validation.
- **Scale Expansion**: Pilot is capped at [N] clinicians and [M] patients (as defined in Pilot Agreement).

## 7. Pilot User Eligibility and Limits
- **Clinician Eligibility**: Board-certified clinicians within the Zenthea network.
- **Patient Eligibility**: Patients who have signed the "Pilot Interaction Consent" form.
- **Volume Limits**: Pilot usage is limited to [Insert Number] consultations per week per clinician.

## 8. Human Responsibilities and Oversight
- **The Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: The clinician is the ultimate authority. Every word generated by Zenthea must be reviewed, edited if necessary, and approved by the human clinician.
- **Audit Trails**: All approvals and edits must be logged for quality assurance and safety auditing.
- **Safety Reporting**: Any hallucination or clinical error must be reported via the internal escalation path within 4 hours.

## 9. Support, Escalation, and Kill Switch
- **Support Path**: Pilot clinicians have direct access to the Zenthea Engineering and Clinical Safety teams.
- **Escalation**: Technical failures or safety concerns bypass standard support and go directly to the CTO/Clinical Lead.
- **Kill Switch**: The system can be put into "Read-Only" mode or taken offline immediately by Zenthea leadership if a safety risk or data breach is suspected.

## 10. Signals of a Successful Pilot Transition
- **Documentation Accuracy**: >95% clinician acceptance rate of generated summaries.
- **Time Savings**: Measurable reduction in clinician "pajama time" (post-visit charting).
- **Safety**: Zero unauthorized PHI disclosures and zero unreviewed clinical outputs.
- **Feedback**: Qualitative confirmation from clinicians that the Zenthea assist loop improves their workflow.
