# Phase X Execution Planning Lock

## 1. Status and Scope
**Status:** DESIGN-ONLY GOVERNANCE LOCK  
**Execution Status:** NOT ENABLED  
**Scope:** This document formally freezes the implementation-planning baseline for Phase X (X-01 through X-05) of the Zenthea platform. It defines the boundary of permitted planning activity and establishes the immutable design state required before any transition to operational execution.

## 2. Purpose of This Lock
This lock is established to ensure that the comprehensive design and planning for Phase X are frozen as a binding baseline. This prevents architectural drift, ensures that all security and safety safeguards are systematically defined before implementation, and provides a regulator-safe audit trail. By locking these artifacts, the platform guarantees that implementation will proceed only against a verified and authorized planning state, mitigating risks associated with ad-hoc or undocumented changes.

## 3. Locked Phase X Artifacts
The following artifacts are hereby locked and constitute the binding planning baseline for Phase X:
- `phase-x-01-execution-implementation-plan.md`
- `phase-x-02-data-and-persistence-design.md`
- `phase-x-03-identity-auth-and-trust-boundaries.md`
- `phase-x-04-runtime-environments-and-boundary-enforcement.md`
- `phase-x-05-execution-control-and-safeguards.md`

## 4. Binding Authority and Precedence
This lock is binding for all subsequent implementation work related to Phase X. It takes precedence over any informal planning, discussions, or legacy design documents. This lock operates within the framework established by the Architecture Baseline Declaration and follows the successful closure of the Phase W Execution Design Lock. Any conflict between subsequent implementation proposals and these locked artifacts must be resolved through formal governance channels before proceeding.

## 5. Execution Status Declaration
**Execution remains NOT ENABLED.** The existence of this planning lock does not constitute permission to build, deploy, or activate any components described within the locked artifacts. This document is a governance checkpoint signifying that planning is complete and frozen; it is not an operational authorization.

## 6. Prohibited Interpretations
The following interpretations of this document are explicitly prohibited:
- **Partial implementation:** Implementing elements of Phase X piecemeal before full enablement.
- **Shadow execution:** Commencing build activities under the guise of "preparation" or "prototyping."
- **Silent enablement:** Activating any Phase X functionality without explicit, documented governance approval.
- **“Safe” shortcuts:** Deviating from the locked design for perceived efficiency or expediency.
- **Assistant-triggered actions:** Interpreting this lock as an instruction for an AI assistant or any automated system to begin implementation.

## 7. Permitted Activities After This Lock
Following the establishment of this lock, only the following activities are permitted:
- **Phase Y planning:** Commencing the design and planning for subsequent phases.
- **Backlog creation:** Translating locked requirements into non-executable backlog items for future tracking.
- **Staffing and sequencing discussions:** Determining the resources and order of operations for future enablement.

**Explicitly Prohibited:** Deployment of code, wiring of services, activation of infrastructure, or any operational activity related to Phase X.

## 8. Change Control Rules
Any amendment to the Phase X planning baseline requires formal governance review and the issuance of a new Execution Planning Lock. There shall be no implicit edits, silent updates, or unauthorized modifications to the locked artifacts. All changes must be tracked, justified, and formally approved through the established platform governance process.

## 9. Relationship to Other Governance Artifacts
This document must be read in conjunction with:
- Architecture Baseline Declaration
- Phase W Execution Design Lock
- Execution Architecture Plan
- Platform Status Document

These documents collectively define the governance framework and current state of the Zenthea platform.

## 10. Closing Governance Statement
This Execution Planning Lock authorizes NOTHING operational. It is a design-only artifact that freezes the planning state. Execution of Phase X remains BLOCKED and will continue to be blocked until future governance explicitly enables it through a separate, formal authorization event.
