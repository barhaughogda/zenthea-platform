# Phase J Completion Declaration

## 1. Status Summary
- **Phase**: J
- **Status**: Design Complete
- **Execution**: BLOCKED

## 2. Scope Covered
- **J-01 Agent Runtime & Daily Interaction Loop**: High-level design for the continuous interaction loop between users and the Zenthea assistant, focusing on state transitions and interaction triggers.
- **J-02 Session and Identity Binding**: Design for secure binding of conversational sessions to verified identities, ensuring continuity and security across interactions.
- **J-03 Memory Model and Trust Boundaries**: Architectural framework for managing short-term and long-term memory while maintaining strict trust boundaries between user data and assistant logic.
- **J-04 Conversational UX & Response Discipline**: Governance rules and interaction patterns for a clear, disciplined, and safe conversational experience, emphasizing refusal over unauthorized generation.

## 3. What Phase J Achieves
- Defines Zenthea as a daily-use AI assistant, prioritizing reliability and consistency.
- Establishes safe, governed conversational interaction through clear boundaries and response discipline.
- Enables voice and UI interaction design without authorizing any execution logic.
- Treats trust, refusal, and clarity as first-class system properties, ensuring safety is built into the interaction model.
- Preserves strict non-executing posture, limiting the system to design and understanding.

## 4. What Phase J Does NOT Authorize
- Any execution or automation of tasks or workflows.
- Any external system interaction or data exchange with outside services.
- Any persistence beyond session scope, except where explicitly defined for memory design.
- Any content generation guarantees or commitments to specific AI outputs.
- Any clinical, therapeutic, or medical authority; Zenthea is not a healthcare provider.
- Any production deployment or public accessibility.

## 5. Execution Block Statement
- Phase J does NOT authorize implementation of the designed systems.
- Phase J does NOT authorize deployment of any components or services.
- Phase J does NOT authorize execution of any AI logic or automated processes.
- All execution pathways remain blocked by governance to maintain system integrity and safety.

## 6. Forward Path
- The next phase is Phase K (Trustable Assistant MVP).
- Phase K remains non-executing and focused on further governance and design refinement.
- Execution requires future, explicit governance unblock from authorized stakeholders.

## 7. Closing Governance Statement
"This document authorizes understanding and governance alignment only. It does not authorize implementation, deployment, or execution."
