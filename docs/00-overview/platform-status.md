# Zenthea Platform – Canonical Repository Status

- **Status**: Active
- **Execution State**: BLOCKED

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the authoritative state of the Zenthea Platform repository.

“This document supersedes informal verbal status, chat transcripts, and non-merged local work.”

## Current Canonical Repository State

The canonical state of this repository is defined exclusively by commits present on the `main` branch and pushed to `origin`.

Local branches, historical experiments, unpushed commits, and unpublished work are non-authoritative and must not be treated as canonical status.

## Completed Phases (High-Level Summary)

Phases M through U are completed.

Some governance and demo artifacts may not be present on `main`; however, their objectives are considered satisfied and closed.

## Demo and Governance Phase Closure Statement

Phases R, S, T, and U are COMPLETE and CLOSED.

The demo environment is no longer the primary development focus.

## Transition to Product Development

The platform is transitioning into real product development.

Forward work is focused on data integration, authentication, execution pathways, and real users.

## Relationship to North Star Vision

The guiding vision is defined in `docs/00-overview/zenthea-north-star.md`.

## What This Repository Is Now Optimized For

- **Incremental product delivery on `main`** with reviewable changes and reproducible outcomes.
- **Operational correctness** for authentication, data integration, and execution pathways.
- **Maintainable platform evolution** with clear ownership boundaries and low-risk iteration.
- **Evidence-carrying changes** where behavior is traceable to commits on `main`.

## Explicit Non-Goals

- **Preserving or reviving non-canonical work** from local branches, unpublished prototypes, or unverifiable artifacts.
- **Optimizing for demo-only velocity** as the primary objective.
- **Encoding aspirational claims** that cannot be verified from the committed repository state.

## Change Control and Update Rules

Updates to this document require deliberate edits and a factual, deterministic tone.

Section order must be preserved in future updates.
