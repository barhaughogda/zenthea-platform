# Zenthea Platform – Canonical Repository Status

- **Status**: Active
- **Execution State**: BLOCKED

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the authoritative state of the Zenthea Platform repository.

“This document supersedes informal verbal status, chat transcripts, and non-merged local work.”

## Current Canonical Repository State

The canonical state of this repository is defined exclusively by commits present on the `main` branch and pushed to `origin`.

Local branches, historical experiments, unpushed commits, and unpublished work are non-authoritative and must not be treated as canonical status.

## Completed Phases (High-Level Summary)

Phases M through AF are COMPLETE and LOCKED.

The platform has achieved end-to-end completion from foundational architecture through human decision modeling (Phases M–AF). All objectives are satisfied and verified.

## Current Platform State

The platform represents a fully non-operational but end-to-end product system. 

All execution, planning, and product layers—including Architecture, Data Integration, Identity, Execution Pathways, Scale & Resilience, and the Product Interaction & Decision Layer—are DESIGN-ONLY and LOCKED.

## Execution Governance

Execution remains explicitly BLOCKED. The repository is optimized for non-operational validation, signal capture, and human decision readiness modeling. No runtime activation or state-changing enablement is present or permitted under current governance.

## Relationship to North Star Vision

The guiding vision is defined in `docs/00-overview/zenthea-north-star.md`.

## What This Repository Is Now Optimized For

- **Incremental product delivery on `main`** with reviewable changes and reproducible outcomes.
- **Operational correctness** for authentication, data integration, and execution pathways.
- **Maintainable platform evolution** with clear ownership boundaries and low-risk iteration.
- **Evidence-carrying changes** where behavior is traceable to commits on `main`.

## Explicit Non-Goals

- **Preserving or reviving non-canonical work** from local branches, unpublished prototypes, or unverifiable artifacts.
- **Optimizing for demo-only velocity** as the primary objective.
- **Encoding aspirational claims** that cannot be verified from the committed repository state.

## Change Control and Update Rules

Updates to this document require deliberate edits and a factual, deterministic tone.

Section order must be preserved in future updates.
