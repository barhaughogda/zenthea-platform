# Executive Governance Milestone Summary

## 1. Status and Scope
- **Classification**: DESIGN-ONLY
- **Execution Status**: EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED

## 2. Purpose of This Summary
This document provides a concise, executive-readable summary of the completed governance milestones and the current lock status of the Zenthea Platform. It ensures unambiguous clarity regarding execution status and serves as the canonical governance snapshot for board, regulator, and leadership briefings.

## 3. Governance Coverage Summary
The Zenthea Platform has achieved end-to-end governance coverage, spanning foundational architecture, data integration, identity management, execution pathways, scale and resilience, and product interaction layers. All architectural and product designs are formally frozen and locked, ensuring a stable and auditable baseline for future progression while maintaining a strictly non-operational state.

## 4. Completed Governance Milestones

| Phase Range | Governance Focus | Outcome | Lock Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| W–Y | Architecture, Execution Design, Skeletons | End-to-end architectural design and execution skeletons frozen. | LOCKED |
| Z | Execution Enablement Governance | Governance framework for future enablement established and frozen. | LOCKED |
| AB–AF | Product Interaction & Human Decision Layers | Read-only foundations, proposal systems, and decision modeling frozen. | LOCKED |
| AG | Enablement Reasoning | Theoretical reasoning for controlled enablement and failure scenarios frozen. | LOCKED |
| AH | Governance Evolution & Conflict Resolution | Mechanisms for governance updates and conflict resolution frozen. | LOCKED |

## 5. Execution Status Declaration
**EXECUTION IS EXPLICITLY BLOCKED.** No part of the platform architecture, governance framework, or product model is enabled for runtime execution, persistence activation, or autonomous behavior. There is no partial, internal, or inferred enablement.

## 6. Risk Posture Summary
The governance framework eliminates silent execution, design drift, and authority ambiguity by maintaining strict immutable locks on all architectural and product artifacts. Every design decision is traceable to a specific governance phase and is explicitly decoupled from operational activation.

## 7. Decision Authority Snapshot
- **Governed Decisions**: Architectural design, data schemas, identity models, execution pathways, and product interaction frameworks are formally governed and frozen.
- **Prohibited Decisions**: Any decision involving runtime activation, operational deployment, or unauthorized mutation of locked artifacts is strictly prohibited.

## 8. What This Platform Is Ready For
- **Architectural Validation**: Comprehensive review of the frozen design state.
- **Regulatory Discussion**: Audit-ready documentation for compliance and oversight.
- **Leadership Oversight**: Strategic alignment on governance maturity and risk posture.

## 9. What This Platform Is Explicitly NOT Ready For
- **Runtime Execution**: No code is authorized for operational use.
- **Persistence Activation**: No state-changing data operations are enabled.
- **Autonomy**: No independent system behavior is authorized.

## 10. Relationship to Canonical Artifacts
This summary is a derivative of and must be read in conjunction with:
- `docs/00-overview/platform-progression-map.md`
- `docs/00-overview/phase-lock-index.md`
- `docs/00-overview/platform-status.md`

## 11. Change Control
This summary may only be updated upon the completion and lock of a new governance phase. Any modification to this document requires explicit verification by the Governance Steward.

## 12. Closing Executive Statement
This document authorizes NOTHING.
**EXECUTION REMAINS BLOCKED.**
