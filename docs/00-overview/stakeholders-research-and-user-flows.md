# Stakeholders Research and User Flows (Redirect)

This document has been **merged into** the single governing stakeholder artifact:

- `docs/00-overview/stakeholders-and-user-stories.md`

Rationale:
- Avoid duplication and drift.
- Keep one authoritative source of truth for **stakeholders**, **user stories**, **user flows**, **cross-role interactions**, **citations**, and **gaps**.

If you arrived here from an older link/bookmark, please update it to point to the governing document above.
