# Migration Planning

This phase plans the migration of legacy systems into the platform baseline
(tag: platform-baseline-v1.0.0).

Principles:
- Docs before code
- One slice at a time
- Preserve guardrails
- Prefer composition over copying
- No clinical logic first

No code may be migrated until all planning documents in this folder are complete.
