# Phase AA-01: Execution Enablement Readiness Summary

## 1. Status and Scope
- **Classification:** DESIGN-ONLY
- **Status:** **EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED**
- **Execution posture:** Platform execution **MUST remain BLOCKED**. This summary **MUST NOT** be interpreted as enabling, authorizing, or initiating execution.

## 2. Purpose of This Summary
This document exists to provide an executive- and regulator-readable summary of the current execution enablement readiness posture of the Zenthea platform.

- **Audience**: Board reviewers, executive decision-makers, regulators, and auditors.
- **Scope**: High-level readiness posture only.
- **Explicitly does NOT do**:
  - This document **MUST NOT** authorize execution.
  - This document **MUST NOT** modify any execution state.
  - This document **MUST NOT** be used as a substitute for the formal governance acts and controls required prior to enablement.

## 3. What “Execution Enablement” Means at Zenthea
At Zenthea, “execution enablement” means the formal, governed transition from a design-validated, fail-closed platform posture to a posture in which runtime execution may occur under explicit human authority.

- **Readiness** is the condition in which the platform’s foundations, controls, and evidence are sufficiently complete to be evaluated for enablement under governance.
- **Activation** is the explicit act that would permit runtime execution to occur.
- Readiness and activation **MUST** remain strictly separated. Readiness artifacts **MUST NOT** be interpreted as activation, and activation **MUST NOT** occur without the required governance authority.

## 4. Completed Foundations (High-Level)
The following foundations are established at a high level as design and governance artifacts. These foundations support evaluation, not activation.

- **Architecture baseline**: A declared baseline exists that defines platform intent and constraints.
- **Integration slices**: Cross-domain integration intent is defined through bounded, reviewed slices.
- **Execution design**: Execution is specified as a controlled capability with defined boundaries.
- **Execution planning**: Execution planning artifacts exist to support governance review and readiness evaluation.
- **Execution skeleton**: A non-authorizing structural baseline exists for how execution would be framed under governance.
- **Governance framework**: Phase governance artifacts exist that define authority, readiness evaluation, scope declaration, and oversight concepts.

## 5. What Is Explicitly BLOCKED Today
The following capabilities are explicitly **BLOCKED** and **MUST NOT** be enabled by interpretation, configuration, inference, or internal process.

- **Runtime execution**: Any operational runtime execution path **MUST remain blocked**.
- **Background processing**: Any background processing, passive execution, or shadow execution **MUST remain blocked**.
- **Persistence activation**: Any persistence activation that would constitute operational execution **MUST remain blocked**.
- **Automation**: Automated execution triggers **MUST remain blocked**.
- **Assistant-triggered actions**: Assistant-triggered operational actions **MUST remain blocked**.

## 6. Readiness Signals That ARE Present
The platform demonstrates readiness signals that constrain risk and support auditability, without enabling execution.

- **Deterministic design**: Readiness is expressed through explicit, reviewable artifacts rather than implicit behavior.
- **Fail-closed execution posture**: The default posture is blocked; execution is not permitted by default.
- **Human authority enforcement**: Execution, if ever enabled, is defined as a human-authorized capability rather than an autonomous platform behavior.
- **Kill-switch semantics**: Halt and revocation concepts exist as governance requirements that preserve human control and fail-closed outcomes.
- **Audit and evidence foundations**: Governance artifacts are structured to support evidence-based review and regulator orientation.

## 7. What Is Still Required Before Enablement
All remaining requirements prior to any enablement **MUST** be derived solely from Phase Z and its locked artifacts (Z-01 through Z-05). This summary introduces **NO** new requirements.

- Enablement **MUST NOT** be considered unless Phase Z requirements are satisfied as written.
- Any readiness evaluation, authority determination, scope declaration, oversight model, and drift detection requirements **MUST** follow Phase Z exclusively.
- Any change to Phase Z requirements **MUST** occur only through a new explicit governance phase; it **MUST NOT** occur through interpretation or secondary summaries.

## 8. Risk Posture Summary
Risk is constrained by governance and structure rather than by discretion.

- Execution risk is limited by a fail-closed posture in which blocked behavior is the default state.
- The platform’s governance posture is designed to prevent accidental execution through inference or partial enablement.
- Any pathway that could create operational effects **MUST** remain blocked until the required authority is granted through the appropriate governance process.

## 9. Oversight and Accountability Model
Oversight is defined as human accountability and reversible authority, not as automated confidence.

- **Human authority**: Execution enablement, if ever considered, **MUST** remain a human decision under defined authority.
- **Review**: Readiness claims **MUST** be reviewable, evidence-oriented, and auditable.
- **Halt**: Oversight **MUST** include the ability to halt, pause, or revoke execution permission.
- **Revocation**: Permission to execute **MUST** be treated as revocable and subject to governance control.

## 10. What This Document Does NOT Authorize
This document explicitly authorizes nothing operational.

- It **MUST NOT** authorize any runtime execution.
- It **MUST NOT** authorize any deployment, activation, or operational use.
- It **MUST NOT** authorize background processing or automation.
- It **MUST NOT** authorize persistence activation for operational execution.
- It **MUST NOT** authorize assistant-triggered operational actions.
- It **MUST NOT** be used as an approval artifact in place of the required governance locks and acts.

## 11. Relationship to Governance Locks
This summary is subordinate to, and bounded by, the existing governance locks. Where any tension is perceived, the locks govern and this summary defers.

- **Phase W lock**: The execution design baseline is locked and **MUST** be treated as binding.
- **Phase X lock**: The execution planning baseline is locked and **MUST** be treated as binding.
- **Phase Y lock**: The execution skeleton baseline is locked and **MUST** be treated as binding.
- **Phase Z lock**: Phase Z artifacts (Z-01 through Z-05) are locked as the canonical execution-enablement governance baseline; execution **MUST** remain blocked under this lock.

## 12. Intended Use of This Summary
This summary is intended for controlled, human-facing communication and orientation.

- **Board briefings**: Provide a high-level, audit-ready posture summary suitable for governance oversight.
- **Regulatory walkthroughs**: Provide orientation to readiness posture and fail-closed constraints without implying enablement.
- **Internal alignment**: Provide a single, conservative statement of what is complete, what remains blocked, and why.

## 13. Closing Executive Statement
Zenthea affirms that this document is DESIGN-ONLY, non-authorizing, and intended solely for readiness posture communication. The platform’s operational posture remains unchanged and fail-closed: **EXECUTION IS NOT ENABLED**.
